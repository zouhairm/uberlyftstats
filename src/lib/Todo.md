# Dev

* parse emails into date, miles-driven, cost (maybe in future do type of rides (?))
* do it for Uber as well ?

* accumulate the data into statistics ...

* do some neato plots
cents / mile (mean & variance?) vs. time (allow individual data points to be shown?)

histogram of miles / trip driven
histogram of trip costs


# Deployment

* Don't forget to set env variables for client and api on host ... github-pages doesn't support it, so will need to host on heroku ?
